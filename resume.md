Achievements
----------------------
* My biggest achievement to this date I consider my move to Australia and work I did at Atlassian. In Purchasing department I helped develop a painless purchase experience for our customers. After that, as part of JIRA Service Desk, my team was responsible for tackling most voted issues by our customers. For last 2 years I work in media team. For last year I was feature lead on public links project that allows customers unfurl thousands of links in Jira, Confluence and Trello.
* I've been selected as one of three people from Sydney office to participate in an Artificial Intelligence innovation week that took place in Mountain View.
* As part of the Toggl development team I developed a completely new web experience for our user base of more than 500,000. 
I modularized our client-side Backbone code in order to increase maintainability and facilitate its reuse. 
It utilises websockets for instantaneous synchronisation and can also work offline. [Screenshots](http://goo.gl/ock3gT)
* I wrote the web application for Toggl's hiring campaign as a personal initiative. 
Every applicant can test his or her knowledge and show their coding skills. [Screenshots](http://goo.gl/6aTWse) I released this code as an [open source](https://github.com/soswow/lobzik) project.
* While working at Swedbank I replaced their dated Flash-based stock chart components with modern HTML5 code [Screenshots](http://goo.gl/yI68vj).
* With a colleague at Zeroturnaround, I delivered two successful web projects using Java and the Play! web framework in three months! [Screenshots](http://goo.gl/NW71iC)
* Graduated *cum laude* with my diploma thesis "Face Detection and Tracking Method Based on Neural Networks and Skin Color Segmentation" [summary](http://goo.gl/5D2097)
